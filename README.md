<h1 align="center">Clear My Followings</h1>

Clear My Followings is a web application which aims to clear your followings from dead users, people who do not follow you back, unwanted NSFW and so on: it is an easier way to manage your followings by applying filters and search on them through a easy-to-use interface.

At the moment the only social network supported is **Reddit** but I'm working on to support **Twitter** and **Instagram**.
